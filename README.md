# Qt and SDL Integration Project

This project demonstrates the integration of the Qt framework with the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library to create a GUI application that leverages SDL's functionalities for rendering and handling multimedia.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Qt (Ensure you have Qt Creator installed for ease of use)
- SDL2, SDL2_image, and SDL2_ttf libraries
- CMake (for building the application)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. **Clone the repository**



2. **Install SDL2 Libraries**

Depending on your operating system, you will need to install SDL2, SDL2_image, and SDL2_ttf. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use:
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev



3. **Open the Project in Qt Creator**

Open Qt Creator and select "Open Project," then navigate to the cloned project directory and open the `CMakeLists.txt` file.

4. **Configure the Project**

Qt Creator will prompt you to configure the project. Select the appropriate kit for your development environment.

5. **Build the Project**

Click on the "Build" button in Qt Creator to build the project.

## Running the Application

After building the project, you can run the application directly from Qt Creator by clicking the "Run" button.
